### Task 1- EDA & Stats
This repository contains the code and analysis for insurance datasets.The project focuses on Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and stats to provide insights to guide business decisions.

## Project Overview

# 1. Repository Setup
- Create a GitHub repository with a dedicated branch: task-1.
- Committ progress at least three times a day with descriptive messages.
# 2. EDA & Stats
The objective of this phase is to provide a comprehensive analysis of Insurance Data. Key tasks include: 
   - Data Summarization:
       - Calculate the variability for numerical features such as   TotalPremium, TotalClaim
   - Data Quality Assessment: check missing Value
   - Univariate Analysis: Visualize the distribution of variables
   - Bivariate or Multivariate Analysis:Explore relationships between two variables.
   - Data Comparison:  Examine the variation in Geographical Trends
   - Outlier Detection: identify and Detect outlier
